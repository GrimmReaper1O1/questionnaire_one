# Questionnaire One
## Introduction
Questionnaire One is a fully open source website which is incomplete and can allow people to work on their PHP skills and Javascript skills. It was meant to become an E-learning website but I have since moved on from the project to better things. I have removed functionallity in regards to displaying questions but everything else remains intact including a working library.
## What workes and doesn't work
### What works
The library is functional providing php is set up correctly. The facilities to enter quesiton information also works. There is some decent css and a working menu system. The database may or may not be correctly set up. It may be missing some recently installed functionallity. Uploading and displaying apendix pictures works
### What doesn't work
the javascript in relation to uploading video and audio content is in need of improvement at best. The functionallity to display revolving multiple choice questions has been removed as it had too many bugs, you will have to figure that out on your own. The set up style page also has bugs but can be fixed to change the style of the entire site. The css is ok in some parts but not great in others. The database may or may not need to be improved to enable uploads of content in relation to video and audio. Should be easy to decifer from the classes and sql statements. The subject information page is in need of improvement but would show videos and audio as well as apendixes if uploaded.
