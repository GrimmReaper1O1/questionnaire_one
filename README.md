# Questionnaire One
## Introduction
Questionnaire One is a fully open source website which is incomplete and can allow people to work on their PHP skills and Javascript skills. It was meant to become an E-learning website but I have since moved on from the project to better things. I have removed functionallity in regards to displaying questions but everything else remains intact including a working library.
## What workes and doesn't work
### What works
The library is functional providing php is set up correctly. The facilities to enter quesiton information also works. There is some decent css and a working menu system. The database may or may not be correctly set up. It may be missing some recently installed functionallity. Uploading and displaying apendix pictures works. From memory the administrative functionallity works for hiding features etc. There is a score keeping system which I think worked but without the questionnaire it won't but there are pages to view scores for administrators and users etc. They need improvement but I think they worked. Don't quote me or depend on it.
### What doesn't work
The javascript in relation to uploading video and audio content is in need of improvement at best. The functionallity to display revolving multiple choice questions has been removed as it had too many bugs, you will have to figure that out on your own. The set up style page also has bugs but can be fixed to change the style of the entire site. The css is ok in some parts but not great in others. The database may or may not need to be improved to enable uploads of content in relation to video and audio. Should be easy to decifer from the classes and sql statements. The subject information page is in need of improvement but would show videos and audio as well as apendixes if uploaded.
## Why do this
Just thought it would be shame to waste something I spent so much time on. Feel free, have at it.
